BovineMine v1.7 Documentation
=============================


**BovineMine** is a data mining resource for the Bos taurus reference genome assembly (ARS-UCD2.0). Powered by `InterMine <http://intermine.org>`_, this
platform provides access to a number of datasets from a variety of source.  It also provides customized bioinformatics tools that researchers 
can use to create their own custom datasets. BovineMine is part of the `Bovine Genome Database <https://bovinegenome.elsiklab.missouri.edu>`_
